        <h3>We have a couple of rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We are an [BlaBla] community, anyone underaged will be rejected!</li>
            <li>Be mindful of others in all interactions. We're a pretty relaxed group but making others uncomfortable
                is not cool! Treat others with respect and generally avoid vulgarity and toxicity. Do not talk join user
                blocking in the 3rd person as if the other person doesn't exist.</li>
            <li> Keep discussion in the proper channels. This is to ensure that discussions don't get buried by other
                people interjecting with something completely different</li>
            <li> Enjoy the stay and make friends! If you use common sense you'll be fine.</li>
